- Decide on journals
- Clean language/typos/references in first 4 pages
*- Create a turk code folder, clean code, upload to git
- Acknowledge NSF, reproducibility details
- Cite software used

25/01/2016
- journals: jcgs, tvcg, comp. stats, econometrics
*- subfigured
*- titles of graphics
- supplementary

*- calculate using weighting by number of selections
*- check model fits with R
*- check confidence interval calculations, bootstrap and/or permutation
*- code cleanup
*- "select" replace for pick and choice
*- "evaluations" replace "attempts"
*- subjects with more than 10, only use the first 10. 
*- conclusions: bullet point main findings

5/01/2016
*-redo residual diagnostics
*-do level 2 diag according to PhD thesis (includes random effects plot)
-redo symmetry restrictions
*-rerun model on new grid
*-redo time model with weighting
*- figure refs/labels
*- check bibliography
- all sas work hopefully
- spell check
- figure resizing
- investigate the poor performers, high performers
*- table of lineup evaluations
*- calculate the number of selections on each lineup, were some more likely to choose more than 1
*- by subject
*- think about how to incorporate multiple selections in evaluating subjects

*- fix biblio
*- captions: first sentence what is the basic structure of plot, e.g Scatterplot of proportion detected against correlation. Second sentences explain details color, shape, lines, ... Third sentence what do you expect the reader to learn by looking at the plot e.g. Proprtion dtected is higher when correlation is large.  Always add a "."
*- Investigate the extreme residuals
*- plot random effects
*- subject plots, like proportion correct for each subject and display histogram
* - lineup plots, proportion correct for each lineup
*- reasons plots
*- fix grid of predicted values
- sizing of figures

16/12/2015

- subsectioning
*- messages
*- tables with nice row/col labels
*- formula cleanup
*- SAS
*- demographics plots
- acknowledgements: software, NSF grant 

15/12/2015

*- chunk options, ermove messages
*- proportion differnce plot - make into errorbars
*- clean code chunks
*- remove the NA value for smooth on the last line
*- why only one pin plot. add the rest
*- notation for the model
*- subsectioning
*- find other software to do weighted glm (SAS, ASREML)

3/12/2015

*- Convert what you have to latex, Rnw: https://github.com/niladrir/metrics-paper
*- Handling the multiple choice - Lendie Follett's paper - adjusting calculations
*- Break into main paper and supplementary material
